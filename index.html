To push your changes to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your project:
    ```sh
    cd /home/klein/Development/code/phase-0/labs/phase-0-html-link-tag-with-href
    ```

2. Initialize a new Git repository if you haven't already:
    ```sh
    git init
    ```

3. Add your changes to the staging area:
    ```sh
    git add index.html
    ```

4. Commit your changes with a message:
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Add link to Flatiron School"
    ```

5. Add the remote repository URL (replace `<your-repo-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository):
    ```sh
    git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
    ```

6. Push your changes to the remote repository:
    ```sh
    git push -u origin master
    ```
